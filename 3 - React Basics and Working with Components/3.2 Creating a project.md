### Using create-react-app

- Using Create React App to create a new React Project

<br/><hr/>
## Creating a new project

1. Open Terminal
2. Go to the folder directory
3. Copy `'npx create-react-app [name of the project]'`
4. After the installation, go to the project folder
5. Run `'npm start'`

### Files Structure

1. Source code will be stored in <b>src</b> folder
2. `package.json` hold all the dependencies in this project
3. When the url/page triggered, `index.js` will be the first executing page

</br><hr/>

## Code Structure

This part of code is to import the ReactDom object from the react-dom library:

```javascript
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
```

This part of code is to tell React to create the main root/entry point from the element:

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
```

The code is to render the App component on the root element:

```javascript
root.render(<App />);
```

<br/><hr/>
## Index.html
-  ```index.html``` is the only html being used in the overall React application because this is so called ```Single Page Application```, which only have single html page.
- All content from React will be render in root ```<div>``` 

<br/><hr/>
## App.js

This is the component file that React recognise
- The ```App``` itself is a default app that will return as a component
- It will return it as a DOM

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
