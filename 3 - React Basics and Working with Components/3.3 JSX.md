# React Tutorial 3.3 JSX

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the return part of the following code from `app.js`, the part of the `<div>` chunk of codes are refering to <b>`JSX`</b> file, JSX is stands for Javascript XML file.

<br/><hr/>

- We can open the developer tool from Chrome, and check on the sources.
- Locate to static/js, click thru the files in the folder, the React transformed code is which processed the components.
- In `main.chunk.js`, we can see the component written has been transformed into another type of syntax.

<br/><hr/>

### Why JSX?

- To reduce the imperative code that we have to write in normal javascript
- In normal javascript, adding a paragrah in another DOM might need a few lines of codes.

```javascript
const paragraph = document.createElement("p");
paragraph.textContent = "This is a new paragrah";
document.getElementById("root").append(paragraph);
```

With JSX, we actually can just declare in the ```<div>``` block:
```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
      <p>This is a new paragrah</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
