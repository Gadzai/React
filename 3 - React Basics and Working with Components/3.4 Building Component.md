# React Tutorial 3.4 Building Component

We can create a folder as a component folder, so that all the components can put inside.

The components are rooted from the `<App/>` follow with the `<Header/>` and `<Tasks/>`.

`<App/>` will be rendered directly in to the html page.

```
A component in React is just a javascript function
```

## Steps to create components

1. Locate to the `components` folder we created
2. Create new file with `[component name].js`
3. Type in the definition of the component

```javascript
function ExpenseItem() {
  //From here we return JSX code
  return <h2>Expense item!</h2>;
}

export default ExpenseItem;
```

4. from `App.js`, import the component at the top (Note that we must use Capital Case for our component so that JSX can recognise the component)

```javascript
import ExpensiveItem from "./components/ExpenseItem";
```

<br/><hr/>

More complex JSX to return:

```javascript
function ExpenseItem() {
  //From here we return JSX code
  //In JSX, multiple DOM elements must be returned as one element(div)
  return (
     <div className="expense-item">
      <div>Date</div>
      <div className="expense-item__description">
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <div className="expensive-item__price">Amount</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
